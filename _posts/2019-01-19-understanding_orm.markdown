ORM = Object- Relational Mapping. This is.  a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database. I like to think of it as a library that implements the ORM.


What are the pros of ORM? 
* The data-model is all in one place
* It's flexible for multiple languages
* Cuts down on repetitive code
* It implements patterns
