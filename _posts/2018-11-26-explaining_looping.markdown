 Looping. 
 
 
 My intent is to explain looping well enough that even my father would understand! 
 
 
 1) What is a loop?
       A loop is a line of code that repeats!
			 
 2) What does a loop look like?

do loop
     " I love explaining looping!"
end 		 

 3) How do you stop an infinite loop?
 If the number of loops is not defined, it is going to loop forever. Literally. 
 
 Hit ctrl + c to close the loop!  When in doubt think of it as you're trying to get control (control) and close it (c).
