     My journey to code, was rather accidental. While studying at Rutgers, I was working at my father's pottery studio. Art is a passion that has been passed along in my family for generations. My father had learned from his uncle when he was a young lad, an from there decided in his older age to open a pottery studio. At first I was like an apprentice learning the art and learning the ins and outs of business. One of his students did website development and helped him build his website. It was beautiful and I found it so amazing how she married code and design. Unfortunately, she was taken from us far too soon. My father lost his student, but also lost his webmaster. Everyone he talked to wanted to change the website but he wanted to keep his website as is to memorialize her. I decided to take it upon myself to learn the backend of CMS in order to do some basic web updated to keep the website running smoothly.
		 I would go on to graduate college with a degree in Political Science and Sociology,  and enter the job market. I did not really have enough skills to land a true web developer gig, but I did the transition to marketing. Specifically, ad operations which introduced me to JavaScript. I found this new sort of language so fascinating and wanted to expand my skill set. I felt at a crossroads, do I continue as I have been or do I seek out a new skill set? 
		 That is when on chance, a friend invited me to a community event hosted by the Flatiron School. The panel was about using code as a tool for social justice. These brilliant minds talked about using code as tools for bettering community. It was such an innovative type of thinking. Coding seemed to be calling me, especially as a former liberal arts student, this seemed to be a route that made sense to explore.
